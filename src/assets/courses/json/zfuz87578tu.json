Here’s how it works: Instead of storing data on your device, it’s stored on remote servers that you can access via the internet. This ensures your data is safe and accessible anywhere. How do you think this could be helpful for businesses?",

Imagine if a company could instantly double its storage space during a sales season and scale back after—it’s like renting instead of buying. Can you think of a scenario where this flexibility might be crucial?",
