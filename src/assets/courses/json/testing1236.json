          "text": "Great starting point! Let me break it down for you. Amazon EC2, or Elastic Compute Cloud, provides resizable compute capacity, meaning it allows you to run virtual servers in the cloud. S3, or Simple Storage Service, is used for scalable object storage. Does that make sense so far?",

          "speaker": "Expert",
          "text": "Lambda is a serverless compute service. You write your code and define a trigger, like an API request or an event in S3. When the trigger occurs, Lambda automatically runs your code and scales as needed. You only pay for the compute time your code uses. Does that clarify things?",
