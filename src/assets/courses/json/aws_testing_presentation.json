        "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud computing platform that provides scalable tools such as computing power, storage, databases, networking, and machine learning services.",
        "AWS operates as a flexible, cost-effective alternative to owning physical hardware, allowing businesses to scale resources up or down based on demand, saving costs and improving efficiency.",
        "Businesses can use AWS services like EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for virtual computing and S3 (Simple Storage Service) for secure data storage, acting as building blocks to create tailored systems.",
        "AWS is widely adopted because it offers a comprehensive suite of customizable tools that address nearly every technological need for businesses, from app hosting to AI model development."
