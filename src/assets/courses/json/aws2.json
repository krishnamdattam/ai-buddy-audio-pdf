        },
        {

          "speaker": "Expert",
          "text": "Exactly! Virtual servers like those in EC2 give you flexibility to scale resources up or down as needed. Moving on, let’s talk about Storage. A key service here is Amazon S3, which stands for Simple Storage Service. It’s used to store and retrieve data. Why do you think scalable storage is important?",
          "purpose": "explanation"
        },
        {
          "speaker": "Learner",
          "text": "I guess it’s because data needs can grow over time, so you need storage that adapts?",

        {
          "speaker": "Expert",
          "text": "You’re absolutely correct! S3 scales automatically as your data grows. Now, let’s discuss Networking. Amazon VPC, or Virtual Private Cloud, lets you create a secure environment for your resources. Why might security and control over networking be crucial?",

        },
        {
          "speaker": "Learner",

        {
          "speaker": "Expert",
          "text": "Spot on! VPC provides control over your network settings, keeping your data secure. Finally, let’s touch on Databases. Amazon RDS, or Relational Database Service, helps you manage databases without worrying about hardware or maintenance. How do you think that benefits businesses?",
          "purpose": "question"
        },
        {
          "speaker": "Learner",
