The work packages all have a\nwork package description,\n•\nhas a schedule based on the WBS in an appropriate level of detail, which\nis continuously updated,\n•\nhas a current budget plan, divided into the work packages and is presented in a\nbinding cost structure plan documented and updated,\n•\ncarries out a continuous risk assessment at work package level\nCritical success factors:\n•\nThe project bodies receive the resources necessary to carry out their functions and to fulfil their\ntasks necessary action competence\n•\nThe safe and economical operation of the plants, taking into account the technical, organizational and human factors (HOF), is NND's highest priority.\n•\nIt is therefore always important to ensure that set deadlines are met - and if not, to escalate as early as possible in order to avoid damage or additional costs\nin the project.\n•\nAcross the company, management and those involved contribute to and support the goals and approach through the Project Chair (PV) and the Steering\nCommittee (SteCo).\n•\nQualified resources are available in each phase."

With the entry into force of ENSI Directive G-22\nIn 2020, new requirements must be implemented for all three plants.\nThese requirements are:\n1. Establishment of own data centers on the premises of the three plants to ensure\nisland operation capability\n2. Ensuring the authority of the power plant management through appropriate processes and\nseparate domains In addition, the Axpo Group is relying on a new enterprise architecture, which is heavily based on cloud\nComputing. This is not feasible for the Nuclear Energy Division and the KKL and Zwilag plants, among other things for the regulatory reasons mentioned above.\nLast but not least, the service quality and performance of the current IT service provider Aveniq does not meet the requirements of the plants.\nThe NND project has the task of successfully implementing the IT requirements of the Nuclear Energy Division and those of the KKL and Zwilag plants through the\ncorresponding project goals, which not least requires the insourcing of the entire business IT."

In the following phases, it can only be changed through change requests.\nOut-of-Scope:\ndemarcation Description\n•\nOperational Technology (OT):\nThe safety-relevant OT systems in nuclear facilities (according to ENSI G01) are not in the scope of NND. These systems are already operated in separate physical\nnetworks with their own processes and largely dedicated personnel and were not affected by the Aveniq/Avectris outsourcing.\n•\nSecurity Operation Centers (SOC):\nThe use of a SOC makes sense and is intended for the future. This is currently outside the scope of NND and will be addressed again when defining future operational\nservices, e.g. purchasing externally as a service, as implemented in KKG.\n•\nDemand IT staff\nAny hiring and budgeting of in-house and external personnel by Demand IT is not within the scope of NND.\n•\nPersonnel for specialist applications BFS and SAP\nThe in-house staff responsible for the application operation of the specialist applications \"Operational Management Systems\" (BFS) and \"SAP\" remain in the nuclear plant\norganization (KKL 5 FTE and KKB 3 FTE). This staff is not budgeted within NND, but is to be viewed in the overall context as part of the IT organization. In future, the\nplatform operation of the servers will be carried out by staff from the new KI organizational unit. The basic operation of SAP will be ensured by external staff."
